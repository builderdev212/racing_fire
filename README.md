# Racing Fire
A simple game in the making. Using pygame, this game is made to feel like an old arcade game.
I developed a simple controller for it with an esp32.

# Installation
## On windows:
If you want to compile this for yourself, run `python setup_windows.py bdist_msi`.

To install the application, simply download the msi installer. This will create
a shortcut on the desktop. Currently there is no shortcut in the start menu.

To use the portable version, simply unzip **portable_racing_fire1.0.1.zip**, navigate into the racing_fire folder,
and then double click on main.exe.

## On linux:
If you want to compile this for yourself, run `python setup_linux.py build`.
